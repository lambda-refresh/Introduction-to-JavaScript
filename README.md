# Introduction To JavaScript

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## Advanced CSS and JavaScript

## JavaScript Foundations

## Objectives

- [x] use let, const, var and demonstrate their differences.
- [x] understand and be able to use different operators.
- [x] write a basic for loop / while loop.
- [x] write control flow using if/else statements.
- [x] use function declarations, expressions, and arrow
      functions and describe their differences

ANSWERs:
let, const, var:
var is globally scoped (or function scoped), while let and const are block scoped.``var variables can be updated or re-declared within its scope, let variables can be updated but not redeclared, const cannot be updated or redeclared. All hoisted to the top of their scope, but var are initialized with`undefined` while let and const are not initialized when hoisted. const must be initialized during declaration.

Function Declarations are loaded before any code is executed and saved for later use. These are invoked or called by using their function name followed by parentheses. These are also "hoisted". ex: `functionName()`
Function expressions are usually stored in variables, but can also be IIFEs (immediately invoked function expressions). Called using the variable name. Not hoisted.

## Introduction

Today you'll worth through 7 JavaScript Tasks to practice today's objectives and get familiar and comfortable with the foundations of JavaScript.

Exercises are outlined in the `index.js` file, please read the instructions carefully for each task and complete it. Note that you may have to use your googling skills to research and look things up if you do not have all the information you need to complete the task.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test:watch` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2: MVP

Find the `index.js` file and complete the tasks as written.

As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, try any of the following challenges. As always, note that these may require additional research beyond what you learned in this module.

- [x] See tasks labelled stretch. Please ensure you've completed MVP before you attempt the stretch goals. Note that you may need to look forward to tomorrow's training kit in order to complete the task.

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

Please see Canvas for submission instructions specific to your cohort
